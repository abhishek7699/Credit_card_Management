## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit-plan`.
- FR-004 explicitly enforces the constitution's zero-raw-card-data principle for notification content.
- FR-005 enforces idempotency per constitution Principle III.
- SC-006 enforces 100% coverage per constitution Principle II.
- Retry of failed deliveries is explicitly out of scope (documented in Assumptions).
